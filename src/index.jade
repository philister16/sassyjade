      h2 Nice to meet you ;-)
      p I am here to give you a headstart developing front-ends with Sass, Jade and Gulp.
      h3 Where to start?
      p Switch to your terminal and kick-off all the pre-defined Gulp tasks, including compiling your Sass and Jade.
      pre
        code ~$ gulp watch
      p If you prefer to work on your Jade only and don't bother about the styling just yet you can also just watch for changes in your templates.
      pre
        code ~$ gulp watch-jade
      p And the other way: just care about style (who does't...?) then we have you covered.
      pre
        code ~$ gulp watch-sass
      h3 What's next?
      p #[a(href="#") Learn more] about all the pre-built Gulp tasks, my opinionated workflow and read the #[a(href="#") docs]. See ya!
